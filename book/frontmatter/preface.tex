\textsf{Creation is a long and twisty path, fraught with the distractions of a life well-lived and
the frenetic pace of a day and age that clamors for a million tiny bits of our attention. A
supportive and loving family is the touchstone that grounds us through it all. Franklin would
like to thanks his family, especially his loving wife for making it possible to maintain focus
in a focus-stealing world.}

\textsf{Feedback has been a key component in getting these words organized into the order
they appear before you today. Special thank you to all the reviewers including
Aaron Didier (@phreakinggeek).}
