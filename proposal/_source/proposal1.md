Over the past five or so years I've been doing security development work, previously at SalesForce and now at Palo Alto Networks. I've developed a pattern of working that allows me to rapidly prototype ideas and get them through the CI/CD pipeline and into production.

This book is me capturing that way of working as a teachable framework for experimentation and giving folks a way to affordably access some of the latest and greatest technologies available today. The information it contains is suitable for folks new to the Information Security, Information Technology, and Software industries, as well as seasoned professionals looking to expand their skillsets. I like to think of this framework as a path that folks can follow to get into the world of software development and operations, more commonly known as "DevOps".
