There are also code examples in a second (already public) repository
for folks to follow along and see/try examples:

## Market 

*Who is your target audience and how will your book meet their needs?*

I've written this with folks from the security community in mind. I hear people 
say a lot that they are curious about geting started with SecDevOps concepts such 
as coding and understanding cloud technologies. I think this writing will provide a 
good "quickstart" path to accomplish exactly that. 


*Discuss the market for your book.*

This book could be described as a pathway to starting out in (Sec)DevOps.

My assumption is this would be a good book for folks new to the industry to follow 
along with. By this I don't just mean young or school-aged folks.
I see that there is also a need for folks who have been in the workforce 
for some years (or even decades!) to re-tool and adapt to rapidly changing 
technological landscape. 

### Competition

*List any competing titles. How will your work compete?*

I realize there are many titles out there that deep dive on the subjects
that I cover in this book, offering a depth of knowledge in an area. 
This book would instead take a breadth of knowledge approach.
